            <p>
                Hello, I'm Cassidy. You can also call me Cass. I really love working with computers. Learning new technologies and creating something new is one of my favorite things. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I'm studying physics and calculus in my current quarter. I work at the media center for my school helping other students with all kinds of technological tasks covering subjects like photography, printing, computer program help and lots of others. In my spare time I'm enjoying learning the C++ language and building small prototype games with the Godot engine. Stepping away from computers, I love to enjoy the natural wonders of the pacific northwest. The pacific northwest has been home to me for more than 2 decades. Some of my favorite activities include exploring beaches, forests, parks and photographing wildlife. I'm also a huge fan of music one of my dreams is to work as a recording engineer for great bands.
